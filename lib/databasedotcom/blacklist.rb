  # Sometimes you don't want all of the SObjects or SObject fields. One vexing situation is an
  # SObject that has a huge number of fields because a query on that object can exceed the
  # maximum number of characters allowed in the URL path (8192). This produces a 500 error that
  # is quite difficult to understand. The solution is to remove some of the fields from the
  # SObject so the query URL is less than the 8192 character limit.
  #
  # You can effectively hide entire SObjects or individual fields via the blacklist. Create a hash
  # with keys 'classes' and/or 'fields' and specify the classes (as an array) and fields (as a hash of 
  # class / fieldname array pairs) to be excluded. 
  #
